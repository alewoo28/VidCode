This is coding challenge for Vidcode's Interactive Developer Frontend position.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION/PROMPT: Please recreate the table below using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is part of a page in
Vidcode’s ‘Classroom Dashboard’ tool, which displays a student’s scores and submissions for
activities in a course. Use the JSON object, attached separately, as the data returned from the
API (you MUST use this JSON object in your build! Do not hard-code any of the information that
appears in the JSON object).
